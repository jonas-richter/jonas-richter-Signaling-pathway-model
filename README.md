# jonas-richter-Signaling-pathway-model
Asim Bikas Das et al. \cite{r0} have published a signaling network model based on COPASI (COmplex PAthway SImulator) and simulated the impact of several cancerous perturbations. The aim of my project was to detect and adjust for flaws in the model. This version is saved as edited model.

## Original model_perturbations
This folder contains the original model by Asim Bikas et al., downloaded from https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/BIOMD0000000648, as versions of the model with simulated cancerous perturbations.

## Edited model_perturbations
This folder contains versions of my edited model BIOMD0000000648_V40_final with simulated cancerous perturbations

## Plots
This folder contains all plots shown in my report as .png files.
### Edited model_factor10to100
This sub-folder contains all plots generated with the edited model, showing only one time frame (corresponds to Figure 7-11 in the report)
### Edited model_long term
This sub-folder contains all plots generated with the edited model, showing 4 time frames (corresponds to Figure S6-S10 in the report)
### Recapitulate_factor1
This sub-folder contains all plots generated with the original model, showing only one time frame (corresponds to Figure 1-5 in the report and Figure 2-6 of the publication by Asim Bikas et al.)
### Recapitulate_long term
This sub-folder contains all plots generated with the original model, showing only 4 time frames (corresponds to Figure S1-S5 in the report)

## BIOMD0000000648
Original model as downloaded from https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/BIOMD0000000648, without simulated cancerous perturbations

## BIOMD0000000648_V40_final
Edited model, without simulated cancerous perturbations. Saved as COPASI file and XML file
